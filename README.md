üèõÔ∏è Project Philosophy & Architecture
Moodify was designed with scalability, performance, and user experience at its core.
Frontend: The React application is built on a modular and scalable architecture. State is managed with Zustand, using separate stores for different domains (player, auth, UI) to ensure maintainability. An offline-first approach is central to the design, providing a reliable experience regardless of network conditions.
Backend: The Express.js server follows a classic MVC-like pattern, separating concerns into routes, controllers, models, and a robust service layer. This ensures that business logic is decoupled and testable. Real-time communication is cleanly handled by a dedicated Socket.IO module, while heavy computational tasks like generating recommendations are offloaded to scheduled cron jobs, keeping the API fast and responsive.
